# 🟢 A+ Re-Test Criteria — Scarface Trades 5-Minute Break & Re-Test Strategy

An **A+ re-test** is the first 1-minute candle *after* a confirmed 5-minute breakout close that **tests and holds** the breakout level (OR High / OR Low).
It reflects smart-money absorption and level defense — the hallmark of a high-probability continuation setup.

## ✅ Structural Requirements

| Factor | A+ Requirement | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Timing** | Occurs **after** the 5-minute breakout candle closes (within next 1–5 min) | Ensures breakout is confirmed and not intrabar noise |
| **Interaction** | Candle **taps or slightly pierces** the breakout level (≤ 10–15 % of 1 m range) | Confirms liquidity test without reclaim failure |
| **Close Location** | Candle **closes on the correct side** of the breakout level (above = long, below = short) | Verifies level hold and role flip (resistance → support or vice versa) |
| **Volume** | **Light** relative to breakout (≤ 30 % of breakout-candle volume) | Indicates absorption, not aggressive selling/buying |
| **Count** | **First touch only** of the level | Subsequent re-tests have diminishing probability |
| **Context** | Aligned with VWAP + higher-timeframe (15 m / 30 m) trend | Confirms directional bias |
| **Follow-Through** | Often followed by **tight 1 m base** or immediate **ignition candle** | Validates absorption → expansion cycle |

## 🕯️ Ideal Candle Patterns (Most → Least Bullish for Long Setups)

| Rank | Candle Pattern | Key Traits |
|------|----------------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Bullish Hammer / Pin Bar** | Long lower wick rejecting OR High, closes strong above level |
| 2️⃣ | **Bullish Engulfing** | Engulfs prior red candle, closes firmly above breakout level |
| 3️⃣ | **Dragonfly Doji** | Long lower wick, tiny body, closes above support |
| 4️⃣ | **Tweezer Bottoms** | Two matching lows at OR High showing defense |
| 5️⃣ | **Inside Bar / Tight Base** | Narrow consolidation holding above OR High |

*(Mirror logic for shorts using inverted equivalents: inverted hammer, bearish engulfing, gravestone doji, tweezer tops, inside bar base.)*
